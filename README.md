# AmazonCellPhoneReviewRatings
The goal of this project is to determine whether buying a cell phone from Amazon is worth it or not depending on the reviews from the customers.

The strategy used in this project is sentiment analysis where texts or word reveal an understanding of the user attitude or behavior towards a topic or subject. The two columns that were used for sentiment analysis was the body since it contained the most words. 

1. Loaded the dataset and get rid of null values
2. Created a pie chart to see the percentage of the highest rating and lowest rating from the customers.
3. Created three additional columns including positive, negative, and neutral reviews to gain a better understanding where the words or texts of the customers falls in.
4. Created a python function to determine whether purchasing a cell phone from Amazon is worth it, not worth it, or it depends on the indivdual. The result was neutral meaning it would depend on the individual of how they percieve the phone. These factors could be quality, price, number of GBs, etc.
5. Printed the score of the reviews and it appeared that more than 17,000 reviews were neutral about buying a cell phone from Amazon which was significantly higher than the positive and negative reviews.
